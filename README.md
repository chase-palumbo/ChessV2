# Chasing Chess
A chess app where you can play against the computer, as well as with two people.  Made with vanilla JavaScript.  

I am very proud of this app.  This was a great project to make and really taught me how to create and use algorithms and manage lots of data, along with making my code modular, readable, and reusable.
